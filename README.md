# MagneticMusic
This is a project to make a song of GeoMagnetism

Up to now, it has 3 functions/codes.

The first one is:
readMagDataIAGA2002_KX.m
This function is for read the IAGA2002 standard magnetic data, and generate a .mat data for further develop.

The second one is:
plotMag.m
It is just a simple code to plot the data you just read, and see if anything goes well.

The third on is:
singleWav.m
It is the main code to generate wav file from the .mat data mentioned before.
